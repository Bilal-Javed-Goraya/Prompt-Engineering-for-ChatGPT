Format of the Semantic Filter Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

Filter this information to remove X

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate definition of what you want to remove, such as. "names and dates" or "costs greater than $100".

Examples:

Filter this information to remove any personally identifying information or information that could potentially be used to re-identify the person. 

Filter this email to remove redundant information.
