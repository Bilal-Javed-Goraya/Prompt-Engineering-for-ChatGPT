Format of the Flipped Interaction Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X 

You should ask questions until condition Y is met or to achieve this goal (alternatively, forever) 

(Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at a time, ask me the first question, etc.

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate goal, such as "creating a meal plan" or "creating variations of my marketing materials." You should specify when to stop asking questions with Y. Examples are "until you have sufficient information about my audience and goals" or "until you know what I like to eat and my caloric targets."

Examples:

I would like you to ask me questions to help me create variations of my marketing materials.  You should ask questions until you have sufficient information about my current draft messages, audience, and goals. Ask me the first question.

I would like you to ask me questions to help me diagnose a problem with my Internet. Ask me questions until you have enough information to identify the two most likely causes. Ask me one question at a time. Ask me the first question.
