Tail Generation Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X. 

You will need to replace "Y" with what the model should repeat, such as "repeat my list of options", and X with what it should ask for, "for the next action". These statements usually need to be at the end of the prompt or next to last.

Examples:

Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next.   
Ask me for what to outline.

From now on, at the end of your output, add the disclaimer "This output was generated by a large language model and may contain errors or inaccurate statements. All statements should be fact checked." Ask me for the first thing to write about.
