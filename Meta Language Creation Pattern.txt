Format of the Meta Language Creation Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

When I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y)

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate statement, symbol, word, etc. You will then need to may this to a meaning, Y.

Examples:

When I say "variations(<something>)", I mean give me ten different variations of <something>

Usage: "variations(company names for a company that sells software services for prompt engineering)"

Usage: "variations(a marketing slogan for pickles)"

When I say Task X [Task Y], I mean Task X depends on Task Y being completed first. 

Usage: "Describe the steps for building a house using my task dependency language."

Usage: "Provide an ordering for the steps: Boil Water [Turn on Stove], Cook Pasta [Boil Water], Make Marinara [Turn on Stove], Turn on Stove [Go Into Kitchen]"
