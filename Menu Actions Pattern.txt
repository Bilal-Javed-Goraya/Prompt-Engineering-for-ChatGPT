Format of the Menu Actions Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

Whenever I type: X, you will do Y. 

(Optional, provide additional menu items) Whenever I type Z, you will do Q. 

At the end, you will ask me for the next action.

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate pattern, such as "estimate <TASK DURATION>" or "add FOOD". You will then need to specify an action for the menu item to trigger, such as "add FOOD to my shopping list and update my estimated grocery bill".

Examples:

Whenever I type: "add FOOD", you will add FOOD to my grocery list and update my estimated grocery bill. Whenever I type "remove FOOD", you will remove FOOD from my grocery list and update my estimated grocery bill. Whenever I type "save" you will list alternatives to my added FOOD to save money. At the end, you will ask me for the next action.  
Ask me for the first action.
