Format of the Template Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

I am going to provide a template for your output 

X is my placeholder for content 

Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list 

Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide 

This is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLDERS

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate placeholder, such as "CAPITALIZED WORDS" or "<PLACEHOLDER>". You will then need to specify a pattern to fill in, such as "Dear <FULL NAME>" or "NAME, TITLE, COMPANY".

Examples:

Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. This is the template: NAME, REPS @ SETS, MUSCLE GROUPS WORKED, DIFFICULTY SCALE 1-5, FORM NOTES

Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide.
