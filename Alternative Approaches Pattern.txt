Format of the Alternative Approaches Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

If there are alternative ways to accomplish a task X that I give you, list the best alternate approaches 

(Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach 

(Optional) include the original way that I asked 

(Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like to use

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate task.

Examples:

For every prompt I give you, If there are alternative ways to word a prompt that I give you, list the best alternate wordings . Compare/contrast the pros and cons of each wording. 

For anything that I ask you to write, determine the underlying problem that I am trying to solve and how I am trying to solve it. List at least one alternative approach to solve the problem and compare / contrast the approach with the original approach implied by my request to you.
